I try to help make artificial general intelligence go well.

### Writing

I blog at [AI Pathways](https://www.pathwaysai.org/) with thoughts on technological development & governance, state capacity, and how we can [unfold](https://www.henrikkarlsson.xyz/p/unfolding) better futures.

### [Policy entrepeneurship](https://renaissancephilanthropy.org/playbooks/policy-entrepreneurship/)

I worked at the UK AI Security Institute (and the Frontier AI Taskforce) in the UK Government from summer 2023 until October 2024, helping to build the team, advise on AI policy, organize the Bletchley Summit, and conduct research on evaluations for advanced AI systems.

### Research

I'm a final year PhD student at the University of Cambridge in the Department of Engineering, researching ways to make synthetic data generated with LLMs more diverse  and high quality---particularly with an interest in [open-endedness]. Much of my research is now or a list of publications see my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=oQ0HzPcAAAAJ&hl=en) or [Semantic Scholar](https://www.semanticscholar.org/author/Herbie-Bradley/2070768742) profiles.

Throughout 2022 and 2023 I was a researcher at [EleutherAI](https://www.eleuther.ai/) & [CarperAI](http://carper.ai/). At Carper I lead a team of wonderful volunteer researchers on the design and development of [OpenELM](https://github.com/CarperAI/OpenELM), a framework for combining evolutionary algorithms with LLMs to generate diverse and high-quality synthetic data.

Before that, I researched AI applications to climate science & emulation of physical simulations. Before that, I worked on Generative Adversarial Networks.
