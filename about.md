<!-- {% marginfigure_left 'mn-id-whatever' 'assets/img/portrait_photo.jpg' 'Herbie Bradley<br>Test' %} -->
I work on open problems in artificial general intelligence.

Formerly, I worked at the UK AI Safety Institute (and the Frontier AI Taskforce) in the UK Government, helping to build the team, advise on AI policy, organize the Bletchley AI Safety Summit, and conduct research on evaluations for advanced AI systems.

I'm also a final year PhD student at the University of Cambridge in the Department of Engineering, working on problems around synthetic data and large language models.

Throughout 2022 and 2023 I was a researcher at [EleutherAI](https://www.eleuther.ai/) & [CarperAI](http://carper.ai/) working on large language models, including the design and development of [OpenELM](https://github.com/CarperAI/OpenELM), a framework for the generation of diverse and high-quality synthetic data with LLMs.

My research interests are primarily related to large language models, including reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), open-endedness with LLMs, interpretability, evaluations, AI governance, and more. For a list of publications see my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=oQ0HzPcAAAAJ&hl=en) or [Semantic Scholar](https://www.semanticscholar.org/author/Herbie-Bradley/2070768742) profiles.

You can follow me on [Twitter][80aa55fa], where I mostly retweet interesting research in machine learning along with the work of myself and my collaborators.
