I'm Herbie Bradley, a Computer Science and Mathematics student at Keele University. I'm interested in computer vision, generative models, deep learning, and much more.
I'm currently working on my final undergraduate project, which is looking at ways to use generative adversarial networks on image translation tasks such as photo$\Leftrightarrow$painting,
summer$\Leftrightarrow$winter, and horse$\Leftrightarrow$zebra.
