# About
<!-- {% marginfigure_left 'mn-id-whatever' 'assets/img/portrait_photo.jpg' 'Herbie Bradley<br>Test' %} -->
I work at the UK AI Safety Institute, working on research to support AI governance and evaluations for advanced AI systems.

I am also a 3rd year PhD student at the University of Cambridge in the [Cambridge Applied Machine Learning Lab](https://caml-lab.com/), Department of Engineering with the [AI4ER PhD programme][ai4er].

Throughout 2022 and 2023 I was a researcher at [EleutherAI](https://www.eleuther.ai/) & [CarperAI](http://carper.ai/) working on large language models, including the design and development of [OpenELM](https://github.com/CarperAI/OpenELM), a framework for the generation of diverse and high-quality synthetic data with LLMs.

My research interests are primarily related to large language models, including reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), open-endedness with LLMs, interpretability, evaluations, AI governance, and more. For a list of publications see my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=oQ0HzPcAAAAJ&hl=en) or [Semantic Scholar](https://www.semanticscholar.org/author/Herbie-Bradley/2070768742) profiles.

You can follow me on [Twitter][80aa55fa], where I mostly retweet interesting research in machine learning along with the work of myself and my collaborators.

I can be contacted at mail [at] myname.com.
