I'm Herbie Bradley, a graduate student studying machine learning. I recently finished an MSc in Data Analytics at Warwick University, where I spent some time investigating algorithms to compress datasets with the goal of training deep learning models faster during tasks like hyperparameter searches. My main interests are generative models and meta-learning.

In autumn 2020 I started an MRes + PhD in [AI for the study of Environmental Risks][ai4er] at Cambridge University, where I hope to explore ways of emulating climate models with ML.

You can follow me on [Twitter][80aa55fa], where I mostly retweet interesting tech news and research in machine learning.

## This Blog

I mostly intend this blog to be a place to post about things I'm studying, in the hope that forcing myself to write about them will lead to a deeper understanding.
I will also occasionally post about projects I'm working on and my views on trends in machine learning.
