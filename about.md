I'm an MSc student at Warwick University studying Data Analytics, interested in NLP, generative models, autoML and uncertainty in deep learning.
I recently finished my final undergraduate project, looking at ways to use generative adversarial networks on image translation tasks such as photo$\Leftrightarrow$painting,
summer$\Leftrightarrow$winter, and horse$\Leftrightarrow$zebra.

## This Blog

I mostly intend this blog to be a place to post about things I'm studying, in the hope that forcing myself to write about them will lead to a deeper understanding.
I will also occasionally post about projects I'm working on.
