I'm a Computer Science and Mathematics student at Keele University, interested in computer vision, generative models, deep learning, and much more.
I'm currently working on my final undergraduate project, looking at ways to use generative adversarial networks on image translation tasks such as photo$\Leftrightarrow$painting,
summer$\Leftrightarrow$winter, and horse$\Leftrightarrow$zebra.

[See my CV][62521714] for more information. You can also follow me on [Twitter][80aa55fa], where I mostly retweet interesting tech news and research.

## This Blog

I mostly intend this blog to be a place to post about things I'm studying, in the hope that forcing myself to write about them will lead to a deeper understanding.
I will also occasionally post about projects I'm working on.
