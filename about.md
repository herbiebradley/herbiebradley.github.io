I'm Herbie, a PhD student at the University of Cambridge in the AI for Environmental Risks PhD programme. My work focuses on emulating atmospheric chemistry models with machine learning. I also recently worked on the [GeoGraph](https://github.com/ai4er-cdt/geograph) Python library, a tool to analyse ecosystems and habitat fragmentation with a novel graph-based approach. In 2019-2020, I studied an MSc in Data Analytics at Warwick University, where I spent some time investigating algorithms to compress datasets with the goal of training deep learning models faster during tasks like hyperparameter searches.

You can follow me on [Twitter][80aa55fa], where I mostly retweet interesting tech news and research in machine learning.

## This Blog

I mostly intend this blog to be a place to post about things I'm studying, in the hope that forcing myself to write about them will lead to a deeper understanding.
I will also occasionally post about projects I'm working on and my views on trends in machine learning.
