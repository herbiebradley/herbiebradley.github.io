I'm an MSc student at Warwick University studying Data Analytics, interested in NLP, generative models, autoML and uncertainty in deep learning.
In my final undergraduate project last year I looked at ways to use generative adversarial networks on image translation tasks such as photo$\Leftrightarrow$painting,
summer$\Leftrightarrow$winter, and horse$\Leftrightarrow$zebra. I am currently working on my Master's project investigating algorithms to compress deep learning datasets, with the goal of training deep learning models faster without losing too much predictive power.

In autumn 2020 I will be starting an MRes + PhD in [AI for the study of Environmental Risks][ai4er] at Cambridge University.

[See my CV][62521714] for more information. You can also follow me on [Twitter][80aa55fa], where I mostly retweet interesting tech news and research in machine learning.

## This Blog

I mostly intend this blog to be a place to post about things I'm studying, in the hope that forcing myself to write about them will lead to a deeper understanding.
I will also occasionally post about projects I'm working on and my views on trends in machine learning.
